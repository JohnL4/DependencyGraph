* DependencyGraph

  An attempt to write a Haskell pgm that turns indented text log output into a GraphViz dependency
  graph.

  I haven't figured out how to make this work, since the "Adding" lines (see file [[file:test2.txt][test2.txt]]) occur
  non-deterministically.  That means you can't drop the same number lines as the number of edges you
  generate.

  Maybe the fix is to try something like =takeWhile=, but then the condition has be basically "until
  indent decreases again".
